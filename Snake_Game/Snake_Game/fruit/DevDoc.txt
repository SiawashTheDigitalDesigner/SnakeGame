// **Fruit Position**: Store the coordinates (x, y) of the fruit. :
Breaking down the task of storing the coordinates of the fruit into subtasks can help you organize your work more effectively. Here's how you can break it down:

1. **Define FruitPosition Structure**: Create a structure to store the coordinates of the fruit.

2. **Initialize Fruit Position**: Define initial coordinates for the fruit.

3. **Generate Random Fruit Position**: Create a function to generate random coordinates for the fruit within the game boundaries.

4. **Update Fruit Position**: Implement a function to update the position of the fruit when it's eaten or when the game starts.
